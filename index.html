            Chester Charles Bennington (March 20, 1976 â€“ July 20, 2017) was an American singer, songwriter, musician, and actor. He was best known as the lead vocalist for Linkin Park and was also lead vocalist for the bands Dead by Sunrise, Stone Temple Pilots, and Grey Daze. As an actor, he appeared in films such as Crank (2006), Crank: High Voltage (2009), and Saw 3D (2010).[1]

Bennington first gained prominence as a vocalist following the release of Linkin Park's debut album Hybrid Theory (2000), which was a worldwide commercial success. The album was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2005, making it the best-selling debut album of the decade, as well as one of the few albums ever to achieve that many sales.[2] Linkin Park's following studio albums, from Meteora (2003) to One More Light (2017), continued the band's success.

Bennington formed his own band, Dead by Sunrise, as a side project in 2005. The band's debut album, Out of Ashes, was released on October 13, 2009. He became the lead singer of Stone Temple Pilots in 2013 to release the extended play record High Rise on October 8, 2013, via their own record label, Play Pen, but left in 2015 to focus solely on Linkin Park. On July 20, 2017, Bennington was found dead at his home in Palos Verdes Estates, California. His death was ruled a suicide by hanging.

Bennington has been credited by several publications as one of the greatest rock vocalists of his generation.[3] Hit Parader magazine placed Bennington number 46 on their list of the "100 Metal Vocalists of All Time".[1] Writing for Billboard, Dan Weiss stated that Bennington "turned nu-metal universal".[4]

        <code ><br>At around 9:00 a.m. PDT on July 20, 2017, Bennington was found dead by his housekeeper at his home in Palos Verdes Estates, California.[60][61] His death was ruled a suicide by hanging. Bandmate Mike Shinoda confirmed his death on Twitter, writing, "Shocked and heartbroken, but it's true. An official statement will come out as soon as we have one."[62] On July 21, Brian Elias, the chief of operations for the office of the medical examiner-coroner, confirmed that a half-empty bottle of alcohol was found at the scene, but no other drugs were present.[63] It was later reported in December that Bennington's toxicology report showed "a trace amount" of alcohol in his system at the time of death.[64] The band announced that they had canceled the North American leg of their One More Light Tour following his death, and that tickets would be refunded.[65] Since his death, there is no official word on Linkin Park's future as of 2020.[66]</code>
